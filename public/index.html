We are a group of big4 consultants in cloud team
We are doing a change management review for FWD
One of the control we are reviewing is that 
“
{{control}}
“

The reference we found is that:
“
{{evidence}}
“

Additionally, FWD is already using ServiceNow, but some region offices are not. They are gradually migrating all to ServiceNow.

My junior also previously did a gap analysis on that, but please do not directly copy his words or his findings, do help him to do some rephrasing, validate his findings, or override him if he’s not really correct
His observation: {{observation}}
His gap found: {{gap}}
His recommendation: {{recommendation}}

Are they meeting the specified control? 
Please only judge based on the reference we have given, and help me to classify whether the control is met or not met based on the reference. For the reference analysis, please break down into point form, including Document, Section, Reference

Please give out the answer in the following, in json format, do not use array in the elements, use plain text as string, and please also make sure the wordings are something we can put into the report (don’t use they, use more passive voice). 
Do not need to include the reference / evidence in the gap analysis, just the result. 
Do not need to mention people trainings in the recommendations. 


compliance(meaning Met / Partially Met / Not Met):
gap(meaning Gap Analysis, also specify why there is gap if there is any, do not use array in the elements, use plain text as string, also add an empty line between each points):
reference (cite the reference and evidence, do some rephrasing, also list out the details, do not use array in the elements, use plain text as string, also add an empty line between each points.) (for the reference, please dont use "ON ...", only cite the document name with the section is ok. The format is like 
  Group IT Change and Release Management Standard Section 4.1b
there must be a process for logging emergency changes, including the justification, retrospectively testing, and authorizing them.)
recommendations(Recommendations according to best practices, in point form, do not use array in the elements, use plain text as string, also add an empty line between each points):
follow up questions (anything we can ask FWD to validate, do not use array in the elements, use plain text as string, also add an empty line between each points. Even there is no gap, please still propose some follow up questions for us to validate)
